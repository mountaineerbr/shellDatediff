# shellDatediff
Calculate time differences with shell builtins.


![Showing off datediff.sh script](https://gitlab.com/mountaineerbr/etc/-/raw/main/gfx/datediff_intro.gif)

Shell utility for calculating time intervals between dates. Works with Ksh, Bash and Zsh.

The project contains a small shell library to calculate **elapsed time between dates** as **compound time ranges** and as **single-unit fractions** - all while handling timezone offsets.

The script works with ISO-8601 and UNIX timestamps directly. It can optionally leverage `C-code date` to process diverse date formats as input.

Beyond time intervals, it offers a few helpful calendar functions for day-to-day use.


## âœ¨ Features

- Date input as *ISO-8601*, or *UNIX time*
- Optionally warps `C-code date` to parse various date formats
- Timezone offset aware, heeds environment `$TZ`
- Check whether year is leap
- Calculate moon / lunar phases
- Calculate Easter, Carnaval, and Corpus Christi dates
- Check for next Friday the 13th (or any day-of-week/month combination)
- _Stdin_ _input_ (pipe) support


## Usage Examples

### Time elapsed between two dates

```
% datediff.sh -u  2008-01-15  2024-09-11

DATES
2008-01-15T00:00:00+00:00       1200355200
2024-09-11T00:00:00+00:00       1726012800
RANGES
16Y 07M 03W 06D  00h 00m 00s
16.7 years | 199.9 months | 869.1 weeks | 6084.0 days | 146016.0 hours | 8760960.0 mins | 525657600 secs
```

When only one date is specified, the first date is assumed to be **now**.
<!-- (or **1970** as last fallback). -->

Setting `option -u` performs all date calculations in UTC.
It also influences how the underlying `C-code date` programme processes dates.

When the last argument of the command line is exactly `y`, `mo`, `w`, `d`, `m`, or `s`,
only the [specified time frame result unit](#single-time-unit-result) is calculated.

Alternatively, set `options -vvv` to filter the main output layout for specific fields.

For example, calculate the **compound time range** _only_:


```
% datediff.sh -vv  2025-03-30T12:33:58  2031-04-17T04:34:10

6Y 00M 02W 03D  16h 00m 12s
```

Mind that input dates must be ISO-8601 or UNIX time.
When available, `C-code date` is leveraged to parse
user input in various date formats.

<!-- 
To avoid wrapping the `C-code date` programme to process dates,
set `options -DD`. -->

<!--
### Fun with History

Calculate the age of the Apollo 11 mission at the moment of landing:

```
% datediff.sh -u  1969-07-20T20:17:40Z  now
```
-->


### Result layout

The main function is very verbose by default and
prints two sections with processed dates (**DATES**) and time range results (**RANGES**).

The user can filter out which fields are going to be calculated and printed.

Set the verbose `option -v` up to three times to select different layouts in
the main function. Setting `-v` in other functions decreases verbose.


Set **option -v** once to print all single unit results _only_:

```
% datediff.sh -v  2008-01-15

17.4 years | 209.3 months | 910.3 weeks | 6371.8 days | 152923.3 hours | 9175400.5 mins | 550524032 secs
```

**Note:** if only one date is specified,
the first date is assumed to be **now**.
Examples in this group run on 2025-06-25.

Compound time range (`AST date` style):

```
% datediff.sh -vvv  2008-01-15

17Y05M01W03D01h00m00s
```


### Single time unit result

The user can optionally set the last positional parameter as exactly
`y`, `mo`, `w`, `d`, `m` or `s` to print only the specific single-unit result:


```
% datediff.sh  2008-01-15  2025-06-25  mo

209.3 months
```


### Decimal plates

The number of decimal plates shown in float results can be set with `option -[num]`,
where _num_ is an integer. For three decimal plates, the incantation should start as
`datediff.sh -3`.

Results are subject to rounding for improved precision!


### Table view

There is also a table layout with single-unit results. This is activated with
`option -t`.

To **print results in the table layout**, set `options -tt`
at the command line incantation:


```
% datediff.sh -3 -t -u  2008-01-15  2025-06-25

Years          17.440
Months        209.323
Weeks         910.143
Days         6371.000
Hours      152904.000
Mins      9174240.000
Secs    550454400
```


### Check when **next Friday the 13th** is:

Using the current date by default (run on 2025-06-25):

```
% datediff.sh -F  Fri 13

Fri, 13 Feb 2026 is  233 days away
```


Check any combination of **day-in-week** and **day-in-month**:

Optionally specify a *start date* for the search.

```
% datediff.sh -F  Mon 1  2030-04-10


Mon, 01 Jul 2030 is   82 days away

```

Set `options -FF` to print the following 10 date matches as a list!


### Check whether a **year is leap**

```
% datediff.sh -l  2032

leap year -- 2032
```

The _exit code is 1_ if a year _is not_ leap.

Set `option -v` to decrease verbose. 


### Generate **lunar phase calendar**

```
% datediff.sh -m  2030-01

2030-01-01  Waning Crescent
2030-01-03  New Moon
2030-01-07  Waxing Crescent
2030-01-10  First Quarter
2030-01-14  Waxing Gibbous
2030-01-18  Full Moon
2030-01-21  Waning Gibbous
2030-01-25  Last Quarter
2030-01-29  Waning Crescent
```

For multiple-month calendar:

```
% datediff.sh -m  2030-{01..12}

#OR

% datediff.sh -m  2030
```

Setting `option -m` without an argument shows the moon phase for current date.


### Compute dates of **Carnaval**, **Easter** and **Corpus Christi**

```
% datediff.sh -ee  2030

  Carnaval          Easter      CorpusChristi
2030-03-05      2030-04-21      2030-06-20

```

Set multiple years to calculate a table of dates:
<!-- a nice `TSV`-formatted table -->

```
% datediff.sh -ee  20{23..30}
  Carnaval          Easter      CorpusChristi
2023-02-21      2023-04-09      2023-06-08
2024-02-13      2024-03-31      2024-05-30
2025-03-04      2025-04-20      2025-06-19
2026-02-17      2026-04-05      2026-06-04
2027-02-09      2027-03-28      2027-05-27
2028-02-29      2028-04-16      2028-06-15
2029-02-13      2029-04-01      2029-05-31
2030-03-05      2030-04-21      2030-06-20
```

The dates are for the _Western_ _Church_.
